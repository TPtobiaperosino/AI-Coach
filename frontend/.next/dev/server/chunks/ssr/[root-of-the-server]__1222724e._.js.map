JS finds the code and extracts it.\n// Callback will be used to get the JWT, with a library Auth callback will be read, and then code exchanged with the JWT with Cognito\n\n// The JS, after reading the code calls an Amplify Auth function or a manual fetch --> makes http request to Cognito --> exchanges the code with the JWT\n\n// Just for reference --> fetch is a way to ask data to a server without changing page\n\n// Therefore I need to build a login button that does a redirect for the browser towards Cognito. --> window.location.href = \"https://your-cognito-domain/login?...\";\n// I'll use TypeScript + JSX using react withing the Next.js framework\n\nexport default function HomePage() { //defining the page, using export makes this JS code usable from other files.
